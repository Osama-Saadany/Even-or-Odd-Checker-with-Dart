# 🌟 Dart: Even or Odd Checker 🌟

This Dart program demonstrates how to loop through a list of integers, determine if each number is even or odd, and print the results. It’s a simple yet effective example of using lists, loops, and switch statements in Dart.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- 🚀 Creates a list of random integers.
- 🔄 Iterates through the list using a `for-in` loop.
- 🔍 Uses a `switch` statement to check if numbers are **even** or **odd**.
- 📢 Prints results to the console.

🚦 How It Works

    List Initialization: A list of integers (numbers) is created with random values.

    Looping: Each number in the list is processed using a for-in loop.

    Even/Odd Check:
        The program calculates num % 2.
        If the remainder is 0, the number is even.
        If the remainder is 1, the number is odd.

    Switch Statement:
        Handles the two cases: 0 (even) and 1 (odd).
        Results are printed using print().

🖥️ Output Example

Here’s an example of what the program outputs:

The number 2 is even
The number 6 is even
The number 19 is odd
The number 3 is odd
The number 7 is odd
The number 22 is even
The number 15 is odd

📋 Requirements

    Dart SDK installed on your machine.
    A code editor like VS Code or an online tool like DartPad.

🚀 How to Run

    Copy the code into a Dart file, e.g., main.dart.

    Open your terminal and navigate to the file's directory.

    Run the program with the following command:

    dart main.dart

    Observe the output in your terminal.

🔑 Key Concepts Demonstrated

    Lists: For storing collections of integers.
    For-in Loops: For simplified iteration.
    Switch Statements: For clean decision-making logic.
    Modulus Operator (%): To determine even or odd numbers.

🎯 Challenges to Try

    🔢 Add more numbers to the list and test.
    📊 Count how many numbers are even and how many are odd.
    ✨ Customize the program to work with user input.

Happy Coding! 🚀
